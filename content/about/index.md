I am a French system developper working in Lille, France in an area nick-named "The Roubaix-Valley". I love designing and building infrastructures. I believe in simplicity as a key success factor and ordinariness as a key failure factor.

Currently working on [Ctop][1], a top for containers at night and building [Sailabove][2] Docker Hosting lab [@OVH.com][3] during the day

The linguist in you may wonder what "yadutaf" stands for. You may think of it as French phonetic transliteration of "Plenty of work to be done ahead".

Need to reach me ?
