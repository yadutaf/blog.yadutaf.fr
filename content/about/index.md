I'm a passionate SRE who served for more than 6 years as lead system developer in the robotic team at
[EasyMile](http://easymile.com/). EasyMile is a Toulouse, France, based company building self-driving
vehicles like the EZ10 and the Tracteasy. Before that, I worked 4 years at OVHCloud, a French hosting
company in the shared-hosting and anti-ddos teams.

I love designing and building systems. I believe in simplicity and communication as a key success factors
and learnt the hard way that "the only way to go fast, is to go well" (If it sounds familiar, that's because
I borrowed it from Robert C. Martin).

The linguist in you may wonder what "yadutaf" stands for. You may think of it as French phonetic transliteration
of "Il y a du 'taf'" which roughly translates to "Plenty of work to be done ahead".
