I am a French system developper working in Toulouse, France. I love designing and building infrastructures. I believe in simplicity as a key success factor and ordinariness as a key failure factor.

The linguist in you may wonder what "yadutaf" stands for. You may think of it as French phonetic transliteration of "Plenty of work to be done ahead".

Need to reach me ?
